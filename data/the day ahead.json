  "text": " When  I  think  about  the  day  ahead,  I  realize  that  it's  not  that  busy.  Not  that  frenetic.  It  is  a  very  good  day  to  be  locked  into  what  I  am  doing.  I  will  start  by  checking  up  on  my  starscream  job  to  make  sure  it  worked  as  expected.  THen  Im'  checking  on  updating  reports.  The  goal  of  today  will  be  to  update  as  many  reports  as  possible  without  breaking  anything.  At  6  pm  I  am  going  to  hang  out  with  will.  I'm  unsure  what  I  will  end  up  doing  with  him  but  I'm  sure  it  will  be  fun  if  It  is  cooking  or  chatting  or going  on  a  walk.  How  can  I  Approach  these  tasks  with  a  mindset  of  inner  peace  and  tranquility  while  also  maintaining  a  sense  of  focus  and  purpose.  Interesting  question.  I  guess  I  could  really  focus  of on  the  idea  of  peac of  mind  in  my  work  while  I  work.  Try  to  abolish  insecurity  about  my  work  as  I  do  it.  Just  try  to  doi things  as  high  quality  as  I  can  and  see  what  happens.  I  can  also  ask  for  pairing  sessions  with  people  when  I  am  confused  or  and  know  that  there  are  avenuse for  help  if  I  am  stuck.  what  I  am  thinking  about  to  day  it  is  a  quote  from  zen  and  the  art  of  motorcycle  maintenance.  to  focus  on  climbing  the  mountain  is  a  shallow  goal.  to  take  each  step  and  focu s  on  it  individually  is  what  we  should  do.  The  sides  of  the  mountare  are  where  life  is  and  that  is  where  we  should  focus.  THis  is  kinda  like  my  workday,  or  just  day  in  general.  The  goal  is  not  to  reach  the  end  or  reach  the  top.  But  to  focus  on  the  moment  and  do  things  now  as  well  as  possible.  To  live  in  the  now  without  too  much  worry  fro  th  e  future  or  past.  Whileof  course  we  have  to  have  some  conciousnessfor  bothe  these  things.  By  working  at  acheiving  as  a high  quality  work  as  possible  the  enough  emphasis  and  natural  springing  of  the  future  and  past  come  to  mind.  This  is  all  to  say:  I  will  let  the  holyness  of  my  work  intertwine  with  my  soul.  to  allow  myself  to  be come  one  with  the  work  and  to  release  the  notion  of  a  subjec  object  duality  in  what  I  do  today.  I  will  be  guided  by  the  holy  power  of  the  work  rather  than  the  internal  motivation  of  pushing  past  things  I  don't  like.  I  will  focus  on  the  now  as  opposed  to  focusing  on  the  end  of  the  day.  How  can  I  remind  myself  to  stay  present  and  focus  on  each  individual  step  through  out  the  day?  I  suppose  I  could  allow  my  mind  to  recognize  that  each  moment  is  simultaneously  gained  and  then  lost.  TH  e  only  moment  I  have  is  right  now.  We  all  lose  the  present  for  another  present.  I  will  alwo  myself  to  be  grateful  for  the  moment.  Additionally  I  should  attempt  t o  wholeheartedly  be  guided  by  my  values  as  I  approach  each  task.  To  Take  each  step  and  when  I  need  to  know  where  to  go  next  consult  my  values  as  opposed  to  anything  else,  such  as  my  vices  or impulses.  WHen  I  am  working  on  my  reports  I  will  just  focus  on  doing  the  reports  and  trying  to  be  guided  by  the  holy  nature  of  it.  When  I  am  with  will  I  will  allow  myself  to  be  fully  present  with  him  and  not  focus  on  anything  else.  When  It  comes  ot  incorperating  this  focus  on  mindfulness  throughout  my  day  I  guess  I  can  set  some  reminders.  Every  hour  on  the  hour  to  sit  and  focus  on  the  world  as  it  is  around  me.  to  reallign  myself  with  where  I  am  and  focus  on  the  present  moment.  I  think  taht  staying  commited  to  my  values  is  done  by  realizing  that  values  are  all  that  one  has.  My  sense  of  direction  is  really  all  i  have  in  th is  world.  When  navigating  through  a  forest  one  would  never  disregard  the  map  in  order  to  wander  aimlessly  as  that  would  surely  lead  to  catastrophy.  Values  are  our  compass  in  the  wilderness.  Our  way  to  navigate  through  life  and  make  sense  of  of  the  decisions  ew  make.  Since  I  have  defined  my  values,  I  will  remember  that  when  I'm  doing  things  that  are  distracting  or  impulsive  it  is  saying  that  I  am  either  disregarding  the  map  (for  what  end)  or  I  am  allowing  myself  to  be  guided  by  alternate  values  that  might  not  be how  I  have  chosen  to  live  my  life.  To  conclude  I  think  that  incorporating  self-compassion  and  self -forgivess  into  the  practice  of  commiting  to  values  is  one  of  the  most  important  things  we  can  do.  To  forget  that  we  are  human  is  a  sin  I  have  commited  more  than  i  would  like  to  admit.  to  accept  that  we  are  all  humans  and  we  all  make  mistakes.  That  nobody  can  live  a  perfect  life  and  it  is  through  our  failings  that  we  grow  and  become  stronger  .  Thus  I  think  it's  really  about  refusing  to  take  things  that  I  fail  to  do  too  seriously.  WHen  I  forget  to  follow  values,  the  best  I  can  do  i s  to  forgive  myself  and  gently  reallign  with  my  values  I  can  only  do  this  in  the  current  moment.  I  think  this  aligns  with  my  goal  of  master  of  the  moment.  To  master  the  right  now,  the  present.  This  is  all  that  really  matters  to  me.  As  such  I  think  I  am  done  with  my  reflection  for  the  day.",
