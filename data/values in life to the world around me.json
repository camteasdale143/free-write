  "text": "How  can  I  apply  my  values  in  my  everyday  life  to  improve  the  world  around  me?  I  guess  the  most  important  thing  in  cultivating  the  values  in  ensuring  that  they  are  there  when  I  need  them.  If  they  arent  there  when  I  am  in  a  position  to  act  then  there  is  no  point  in  having  them.  Like  having  gallons  of  fresh  running  water  at  home  but  being  stuck  out  at  sea.  Or  needing  to  open  a  bag  and  struggling  but  forgetting  that  you  have  a  pair  of  scissors  in  your  backpack.  If  you  don't  If  Your  virtues  are  n't  so  soldily  engrained  in  yourself  that  you  can  never  access  them  then  when  they  are  needed  then  there  is  no  point  in  having  them  other  than  to  boast  to  people.  I  guess  a  whay I  could  make  sure  they  are  available  is  to  frequently  look  forward  and  backwards  upon  my  days  and  ask  myself  two  questions  1.  How  can  I  live  today  more  in  line  with  my  virtues.  I.E.  How  could  I  have  been  more  courageous,  honest,  just,  and  self  controlling  in  the  past,  or  how  might  I  as  the  days  day  passes.  the  other  option  2.  might  be  to  look  back  on  the  day  past  and  ascribe  the  virtues  I  outlined  to  what  I  have  already  done.  T  o  say  that  those  actions  were  good  and  to  justify  why  they  were  in  line  with  ym  beliefs  .  In  doing  such  I  can  say  that  my  I  am  on  the  path  to  the  virtuous  ideal  .  I  am  on  my  way  but  still  have  way  to  go.  Over  tha  past  day  how  did  I  fail  to  apply  my  virtues.  The  first  that  I  failed  to  apply  might  have  been  courage.  I  feel  much  anxiety  to  go  and  tell  my  prof  that  I  will  not  bed  oing  research  with  him.  While  it  was  okay  to  stall  for  a  little  bit.  I  think  it  is  time  to  tell  him  my  current  plans  for  the  future  and  what  I  plan  to  do.  It  will  take  courage  to  do  this.  And  the  fact  that  I  haven't  done  it  yets  is  a  failing  with  respect  to  it.  I  can't  think  of  failings  of  justice  ore  honesty.  I  suppose  I  could  have  been  more  honest  with  my  girlfriend  with  how  important  she  thought  valentines  day  was.  to  be  more  honest  with  how  she  makes  me  feel  sometimes  .  to  communicate  this  also  takes  courage  but  is  more  a  virtue  of  honest  y  .  finally  self  control.  I  coulh  have  extended  more  self  control  last  night  when  I  indulged  in  vice  that  I  knew  I  shouldn't  haev  but  thought  that  I  was  \"allowed\"  as  a  part  of  my  resting.  While  resting  is  okay,  indulgence  is  not.  I  should  have  actively  rested  and  done  things  to  accentuate  my  resting  as  opposed  to  indulging  in  vices  that  are  harmful  to  the  soul  and  myself.  I  can  recognise  that  I  did  manage  to  engage  in  self  control  yesterday  when  I  was  working  in  the  morning  and  afternoon.  Tat is  one  success.  I  was  courageous  when  I  had  to  swim  hard  at  practice  .  This  took  courage  to  work  as  hard  as  I  did,  because  It  was  quite  painful.  .  Justice  and  honesty  were  not  really  things  I  had  the  opportunity  to  show  off  yesterday.",
