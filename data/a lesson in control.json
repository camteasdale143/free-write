  "text": " Today.  I  am  going  to  discuss  the  things  that  are  within  my  control  and  the  things  that  are  not  within  my  control  in  my  life. Of  the  things  in  my  life  that  are  not  in  ym  control.  The  largest  is  the  past.  Everything  I  have  done  cannot  be  undone.  THere  is  not  a  way  that  I  can  go  back  and  reset  and  play  again  my  life.  Even  thought  that  is  how  I  like  to  play  video  games.  It  doesn't  work  with  life.  You  can't  have  a  perfect  run.  Sometimes  you  just  have  to  accept  the  things  that  have  happened  and  keep  on  playing  to  the  best  of  your  ability.  No  need  to  throw  everything  away  just  becaues  you  failed.  Kinda  shows like  my  philosophy  to  just  master  the  moment.  To  take  control  of  what  I  can.  The  things  I  can  control  are  living  my  the  beacons  that  I  have  set  out  for  myself.  THe   values  that  I  choose  to  guide  my  life.4  Specifically:  justice,  honesty,  self  control  and  courage.  Those  are  the  things  I  can  control.  If  I  look  back  at  my  swims  over  the  weekend.  I  may  have  made  mistakes.  But  there  is  nothing  I  can  do  about  them.  I  can  only  keep  moving  forward  and  accept  life  the  way  that  it  is.  When  I  consider  the  way  that  I  reacted  to  those  swims,  I  cannot  do  anything  but  learn  to  better  control  my  emotions  and  temper  my  expectations  before  races.  I  cannot  worry  about  the  future  as  that  is  not  under  my  control  either.  All  their  is  is  to  act  under  my  current  values  and  live  virtuously.",
